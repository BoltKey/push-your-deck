Ok. So it will be a push your luck deckbuilding small game.

There are 3 areas:
Supply: Cards can be bought into your deck. Each card has a base cost. Older cards are cheaper.

Deck: Each player has his own deck. In each of his turns, he can one by one reveal cards. When he decides to stop, he can use special card powers, buy from supply to deck and from deck to hand. 3 parts: deck, play area, bust pile.

Hand: Cards bought into hand stay here forever (usually). They provide permanent bonuses and VP.


CARDS:

Each card has various stats.
Cost to deck: How much it costs to transfer the card from supply into your deck.
Cost to hand: How much it costs to transfer the card from deck into hand.
