Ok. So it will be a push your luck deckbuilding small game.

There are 3 areas:
Supply: Cards can be bought into your deck. Each card has a base cost. Older cards are cheaper.

Deck: Each player has his own deck. In each of his turns, he can one by one reveal cards. When he decides to stop, he can use special card powers, buy from supply to deck and from deck to hand. 3 parts: deck, play area, bust pile.

Hand: Cards bought into hand stay here forever (usually). They provide permanent bonuses and VP.


CARDS:

Each card has various stats.
Cost to deck: How much it costs to transfer the card from supply into your deck.
Cost to hand: How much it costs to transfer the card from deck into hand.
Picture??? Something abstract and beautiful
Name
Ability: Here can be literally anything.
Coin value: How much coins you gain from this card if you don't bust
Bust condition: After revealing the card, if the condition is met, you lose your turn.
Color: Red, Green, Blue, Black (special)

That concept turned out to not work.

Here's another idea: You draw a card and then pick 1 out of 4 or 5 spots to place it. Anytime, you can pay something to swap two cards or put a card into the bust pile. If the cards on the table match with one of your combo cards in hand, you can put the card on your tableau
